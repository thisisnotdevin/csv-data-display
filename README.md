# Lab 3 CISC3140 Fall 2021
Lab 3 project, using awk and makefile to produce a data representation using csv files
I found a cool data set from reddit, https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/1uyd0t/200000_jeopardy_questions_in_a_json_file/

# Objectives: 
1. Build a basic data analysis script using awk, it will be using csv data sets to retrieve information.
2. Retrieve only the question, value, category, and answer from the datasheet, which makes it a much more simpler report.
3. At last, we will be using makefile to generate this awk report.

# Instructions:
Clone this repository, once you have all the neccesary files, run makefile which will have the neccesary awk sript and the csv datatsheet. Makefile will automate the report.
