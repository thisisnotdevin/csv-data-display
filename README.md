## Lab 3 CISC3140 Fall 2021
Lab 3 project, using awk and makefile to produce a data representation using csv files which contains tons of information separateed by commas
I found a cool data set from reddit, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/1uyd0t/200000_jeopardy_questions_in_a_json_file/)

# Objectives: 
1. Build a basic data analysis script using `awk`, it will be using csv data sets to retrieve information.
2. Retrieve only the question, value, category, and answer from the datasheet, which makes it a much more simpler report.
3. At last, we will be using makefile to generate this awk report.

# Instructions:
Clone this repository, once you have all the neccesary files, run makefile which will have the neccesary awk sript and the csv datatsheet. Makefile will automate the report.

# Report:
at the end the report should show something like this,
-------------------------------------------------------- 

```The Category is: "WAR MOVIE LOCATIONS" of value "$400" 
The Question is: "The literary adaptation For Whom The Bell Tolls" 
Answer: "Spain"
```
